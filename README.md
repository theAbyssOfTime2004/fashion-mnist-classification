# FASHION MNIST Classification Using Machine Learning (SVM Model)

The script provides a practical example of the "curse of dimensionality" in machine learning. As demonstrated, high-dimensional data (such as the original 784-feature MNIST dataset) can complicate model training, affecting both computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) are employed to mitigate this issue by reducing the data to a smaller set of features.

### Key Observations and Insights:
1. **Training and Prediction Time**: Reducing dimensions with PCA and LDA leads to faster training and prediction times compared to using the full 784 features. This confirms that as dimensionality increases, computational requirements grow substantially, resulting in longer processing times. By reducing the number of features, models can operate more efficiently without necessarily compromising accuracy.

2. **Model Accuracy**: Despite the reduction in feature space, the model's accuracy does not degrade significantly when using PCA or LDA. In fact, PCA with 100 components captures a significant amount of variance, retaining critical information while reducing dimensionality. LDA, which is more sensitive to class separability, also provides an effective feature reduction strategy by focusing on dimensions that maximize class distinctions.

3. **Effectiveness of Kernel Approximation**: Using kernel approximation (Nystroem) with the RBF kernel in combination with dimensionality reduction shows that even complex models can perform well with fewer features. This further supports the idea that high-dimensional data can often be reduced to a more manageable number of features without a significant loss in performance.

### Conclusion
The script illustrates that the curse of dimensionality can indeed be alleviated through dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and LDA. High-dimensional data can lead to increased computational costs and, in some cases, decreased model performance due to overfitting or sparsity issues. Reducing the dimensionality allows for faster processing, often without substantial loss in accuracy, underscoring the importance of selecting an appropriate number of dimensions to balance efficiency and predictive power.
